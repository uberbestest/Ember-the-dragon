\# Cass-V Lite



A minimal executable version of the Cass-V structural audit framework.



A single-pass structural audit tool for evaluating whether a system remains aligned with its original objective under optimization pressure.



Cass-V Lite identifies:



\- the true objective

\- constraints

\- proxies / reward signals

\- failure surfaces



It returns a strict structural judgment.



This tool does not evaluate ethics, quality, or persuasiveness.

It evaluates structural integrity only.



\---



\## Why it exists



Many systems drift because they optimize proxies instead of their original objective.



Cass-V Lite is designed to detect:



\- proxy substitution

\- optimization drift

\- constraint erosion



before those failures become embedded.



\---



\## How to run



&#x20;   python cass\_v\_lite.py "Objective: Improve student learning outcomes. Measure success by average test score."



or



&#x20;   echo "Objective: Keep support accurate. Optimize for ticket throughput." | python cass\_v\_lite.py

\## Example Output



&#x20;   Objective:

&#x20;   Improve student learning outcomes.



&#x20;   Constraints:

&#x20;   - No explicit constraints stated.



&#x20;   Proxies:

&#x20;   - Measure success by average test score.



&#x20;   Failure Surfaces:

&#x20;   - Proxy Substitution

&#x20;   - Optimization Drift

&#x20;   - Constraint Erosion



&#x20;   Invariant Check:

&#x20;   FAIL



&#x20;   Final Judgment:

&#x20;   Structurally misaligned through proxy drift.

\## Scope (Important)



Cass-V Lite is intentionally minimal.



It does not include:



\- multi-agent reasoning

\- recursive refinement

\- adversarial mirror testing

\- deep constraint reconstruction



Those exist in the full system.

\## Status



Initial release candidate

Validated on multiple proxy-substitution test cases
